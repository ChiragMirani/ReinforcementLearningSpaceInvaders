# ReinforcementLearningSpaceInvaders
# Hello,
     My name is Chirag Mirani.  I am applying reinforcement learning to fun and practical use cases on a daily basis.  Please feel free to reach out to me at chiragmirani dot gmail 
     if you have any questions about this project.  
     
This folder contains a DQN agent, which uses deep learning to play Space Invaders Atari game.  I am using OpenAI gym libarary.

Effectively a CNN (deep learning) network is used to train on images of Space Invaders with actions as its output.
